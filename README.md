👋 Hi there! I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Illinois at Chicago (Expected Graduation: May 2025) 

💻 I'm proficient in HTML/CSS, Python, C++, C, Java, and JavaScript, and have experience with technologies and frameworks like React.js, Git, and REST APIs.

🎓 As an ECS Classroom Assistant at Truman Middle College from September 2019 to September 2023, I mentored and provided personalized guidance to hundreds of students, fostering their proficiency in HTML and CSS through hands-on exercises.

🌐 I'm an active member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Google Developers Club, and Linux Users Group.

🔧 I've worked on several personal projects, including a Password Manager with Encryption (Python - Cryptography), a Chrome Extension - Currency Converter with API Integration (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), and a Tic-Tac-Toe Game (JavaScript, CSS - React).

🔍 I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to further develop my skills and make a positive impact. Feel free to reach out to me!
